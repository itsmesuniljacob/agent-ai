Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them until well combined. Add a pinch of salt and pepper. 2. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add the butter. Let it melt and coat the pan. 3. Pour the whisked eggs into the skillet. Let it sit undisturbed for a few seconds until the edges start to set. 4. Using a spatula, gently lift the edges and tilt the pan so the uncooked egg flows to the edges. 5. When the top is slightly runny but the bottom is set, add your optional fillings on one half of the omelette. 6. Carefully fold the other half over the fillings. Cook for another minute until everything is heated through. 7. Slide onto a plate and serve hot.' cooking_time=10 servings=2 calories=200 protein=12 carbs=2 fat=15\n"
